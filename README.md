# violence-_detection_in_hockey_using-_CNN-_and-_LSTM
The objective of violence detection in sports via human posture recognition is to enhance player safety, uphold fair play standards, engage fans, ensure legal compliance, and facilitate data-driven training for improved performance and behavior.

The main areas of interest for this project are computer vision and machine learning. We use multiple technologies to create the model which will help to detect violence in sports.With the help of VGG 16 model and LSTM.

PROCESS FLOW:  data collection and preprocessing -> VGG 16 model flowchart -> Loading the cached transfer values into memory -> temporal feature extraction with LSTM -> RNN and their building bhlocks -> LSTM architecture -> Training.

The graph demonstrates how the model’s accuracy on the training dataset rises with the number of training epochs..Depending on the particular model and dataset being used, the values on the graph’s axes will change.In the provided dataset, the model’s accuracy is at 97.5%.
